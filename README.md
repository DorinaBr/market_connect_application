# MarketConnect Application - a course project
MarketConnect is a dynamic web application designed to bridge the gap between customers and a diverse range of products. It serves as a virtual marketplace where multiple customers can interact with, select, and purchase various products offered by different vendors.

## Core Functionalities

### Customer Accounts:
- Users can create personal accounts with details such as name, email, and password.
- Each customer account should have the ability to follow or bookmark favorite products.
- Customers can leave reviews and ratings for products they have purchased.
  
### Product Catalog:
- A comprehensive listing of products categorized by type, vendor, and price.
- Each product entry includes a description, price, vendor information, and customer reviews.
- Products can be searched and filtered based on various attributes.
- A single product can be purchased by multiple customers.

### Vendor Profiles:
- Vendors can register and create profiles showcasing their company, product range, and special offers.
- They can manage their product listings, track sales, and interact with customers.
- Vendors can analyze customer interest through followers and product engagement metrics.

### Shopping Cart and Checkout System:
- Customers can add multiple products from different vendors to a unified shopping cart.
- The checkout process will handle transactions, including payment processing and order confirmation (TBD).
- A history of purchases and transactions is maintained for customers.
  
### Push Notification System:
- Notifications for customers about new product launches, special offers, and status updates on their purchases or followed vendors.
- The push notification system can be customized by users to receive alerts for specific categories or events of interest (nice to have).

### AI-Powered Recommendation System
- The application can integrate an AI-powered recommendation engine using OpenAI's capabilities.
- This engine would analyze customer behavior, purchase history, and product preferences to suggest personalized product recommendations.
- It would also leverage natural language processing to understand customer reviews and ratings, enhancing the recommendation's accuracy.
- Vendors could use this feature to target specific customer segments with products that match their historical preferences and search patterns.
- The recommendation system would be capable of learning and evolving over time, refining suggestions to align with changing trends and customer feedback.
- Send this suggestion to the client via email, once a month
